# MicCheck_v2
 Shiny app for microscopy metadata reporting v2
 
The app is live [here](http://rebecca-senft.shinyapps.io/MicCheck_v2_WIP?_ga=2.137241591.674207087.1657718133-2036349694.1657718133) if you'd like to check it out. MicCheck v2 has a few new features so far: 

* Support for adding your own microscopes (or cores can add microscopes) to generate custom questions and custom examples of metadata
* A companion uploader app (separate link, not available yet) to assist users in uploading a microscope either with a template we provide or with a series of guided questions
* We're also working on integrations with existing metadata tools.
